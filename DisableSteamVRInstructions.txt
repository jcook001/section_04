Hello to disable SteamVR at the launch of unreal engine I did like this: open the file with a text editor :

C:\Program Files\Epic Games\"Engine Version"\Engine\Plugins\Runtime\Steam\SteamVR\SteamVR.uplugin

modify the line : "EnabledByDefault" : true,

with : "EnabledByDefault" : false,

save the file

The SteamVR plugin will no longer launch with the engine.
